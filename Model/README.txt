	Umesh Patil and Sol Lago (2021).
	Prediction advantage as retrieval interference: an ACT-R model of processing possessive pronouns.
	Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Cognitive Modeling.


2. How to run the models?
-> Call 'source("run-all.R")' within R from the root directory of the code
-> This will run models for both Expt. 1 and 2 from Stone et al. (2021) and generate plots (similar to the ones reported in the paper) for 1000 simulations per condition (see (3) for running higher no. of simulations)
-> Running the model with the default settings takes around 12 minutes to finish and it will take 10 MB of extra space on the hard disk
-> The plots are saved in the 'plots' folder
-> Required R packages:
	. base R packages are sufficient for running the model (Step 1 in 'run-all.R')
	. for generating plots, 'Tidyverse' is needed (Step 2 in 'run-all.R')


3. The R script 'global.R' specifies global variables for running the models.
-> The variable 'sims' specifies the number of simulations to run which is set by default to 100
-> The ICCM-2021 paper reported results from 10000 simulations
-> If you set 'sims' to 10000, the models will take around 100 MB of extra space on the hard disk, and the amount of time increases non-linearly as you increase the no. of simulations
